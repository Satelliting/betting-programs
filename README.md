# Betting Programs


These are just a couple of simple programs that help my friends and I with betting and gambling.

  - increase-interval.py

### increase-interval.py

  - Based on Dice
  - Helps with a simple idea of 'TOTAL LOSS POSSIBLE'
  - Enables you to know how many bets you can withstand if you increase your bet every 'x' bets with a 'y' increase percentage.
